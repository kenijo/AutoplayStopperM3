# AutoplayStopperM3
This is a Manifest v3 compatible fork of the defunct [AutoplayStopper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/AutoplayStopper/ejddcgojdblidajhngkogefpkknnebdh)Chrome Extension.

The code has been partially rewritten to more effectively block videos.

# Description
Stops video autoplay gracefully.

Make video players (flash & html5) show video thumbnail instead of autoplaying.

# Todo
Add an option page to whitelist website to exclude from being blocked.
